CURRENT PROBLEMS TO SOLVE:

	- Walking down slopes properly

	- Jump mechanics as they are very jank right now

	- Logger is shouldnt be an object, it should just be a class holding static methods


FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

	- bitmap text handling (use a still image with look up table to render text on screen bc sdl_ttf can be slow)

	(doing rn) animation system that is very dynamic



POTENTIAL IDEAS:


FUTURE IDEAS:

	- package most of game data in some sort of package to hide stuff
